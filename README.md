# Individual-Self-Assessment-Deliverable

# Self appraisal

I consider that during the 24 weeks in which we were studying this bootcamp I took the necessary time to investigate, carry out the challenges. During this time, I consider that important objectives were achieved, such as: understanding the analysis processes, the importance and development of new skills for the analysis of information and decision making.

# Role during the course of the project

My role in successfully developing the final project was to create the GitHub page, take charge of it as an administrator, additionally develop the databases with which they worked.

As the first phase of this, I generated a series of questions in a spreadsheet where the team could carry out an exercise using excel tools such as search Vlookup and pibot tables.

In addition to this, a code was created in Python in order to format and extract the information to be used, creating a new spreadsheet from the code.

And as a final part, I was in charge of creating an additional code in Pythos to process the information in Tableau for the creation of a dashboard.

# Role in the part that I don't have to work.

In this part, I was in charge of holding meetings every third day outside of the sessions we had on Tuesdays and Thursdays with the purpose of contributing ideas or solving doubts that arose during the analysis process.

# Project summary

  Analyze the distribution channels, through the sales channels provided by the Kimberly Clark company. The main objective is to carry out an analysis of how to introduce the main products or star products (feeding bottles, training cups, nipples and bibs) through E-Commerce, since most of the products are distributed through self-service or specialized services. The goal is to ensure that the target, in this case, new mothers or those who have babies between 1 and 3 years old, can easily acquire our products.

# Communication protocols

We occupied the sessions that we had during classes in the bootcamp, additionally we created a WhatsApp group, a slack group and we scheduled established meetings outside of class hours.

# Results obtained

It was to identify opening points for the distribution of the main products of the Evenflo brand and to ensure that the final target could learn about our new distribution channel and thus achieve that the company could minimize some costs.
